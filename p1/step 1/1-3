			The Web

			It became clear to me, 
			<br />right there, 
			<br />that things had changed. 
			<br />I was not equipped 
			<br/>to play on this new turf — 
			<br />all my investment 
			<br />and effort had burned up. 
			<br />
			<br /><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>I was devastated.</b></p>

			Blogs were gold 
			<br />bloggers were rock stars
			<br /> back in 2008 
			<br />when I was arrested. 
			<br />At that point, 
			<br />and despite the fact
			<br /> the state was blocking access to 
			<br />my blog from inside Iran, 
			<br />I had an audience of around
			<br /> <b>20,000</b> people every day. 
			<br />Everybody I linked to would face
			<br /> a sudden and serious jump in traffic: 
			<br />I could empower or
			<br /> embarrass anyone I wanted.

			<br />
			<br />People used to carefully
			<br />read my posts and 
			<br />leave lots of relevant comments,
			<br />and even many of those 
			<br />who strongly disagreed 
			<br />with me still came to read. 
			<br />Other blogs linked to mine 
			<br />to discuss what I was saying.
			<br /> 
			<br />

			<br />The iPhone was a little 
			<br />over a year old by then, 
			<br />but smartphones were 
			<br />still mostly used to 
			<br />make phone calls and 
			<br />send short messages, 
			<br />handle emails, 
			<br />and surf the web. 
			<br />There were no real apps, 
			<br />certainly not 
			<br />how we think of them today.
			<br /> There was 
			<br />no Instagram 
			<br />no SnapChat
			<br />no Viber
			<br />no WhatsApp
			<br />
