					<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; We Have To Save
				</h1>

				<p style="color:blue;">It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. 
					<br />I was not equipped to play on this new turf — 
					<p style="color:red;">all my investment and effort had burned up. </p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<p style="color:red;"> <b>I was devastated.</b> </p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<p style="color:blue;">Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars back in &nbsp;<b>2008</b>&nbsp; when I was arrested. 
				<br />
				<br />At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an audience of around &nbsp;<b>20,000</b>&nbsp;  people every day. 
				<br />
				<br />Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.
				<br />
				<br />People used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read.
				<br /> Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. </p>
				<p style="color:red;">I felt like a king.</p>
				<br />
				<br /><p style="color:blue;">The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, but smartphones were still mostly used to make phone calls and send short messages, handle emails, and surf the web. There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. 
				<br />
				<br />There was
					<ul style="color:red;"><li>no Instagram</li>
					 <li> no SnapChat</li>
					  <li> no Viber </li>
					  <li> no WhatsApp.</li> </ul>
				<br />
